                            <p class="selectedWork__entry__description__text"> First of all, always be kind. We're all human, and building strong connections with others can positively impact our work and contribute to the overall health of the company. 
                                Building strong relationships through trust, respect, and kindness is a significant milestone, and creating a safe space for learning, growth, and continuous improvement is an art. All above plus being humble, unlocking your potential, being organized, seeking feedback, showing empathy, and valuing peopleâ€™s time are just a few of the core values I live by. </p>

                            <p class="selectedWork__entry__description__text"> I'm always focused on solving the business problems by leveraging my skills in user interface, accessibility, user experience and at the same time continuously working on my development skills to better understand the dev team constraints. I am a great team player and being a design system specialist,
                            my nature is to be transparent, inclusive, communicative, creative and always open to feedback. My work process usually goes from asking the why, research, understanding customer requirements, A/B testing, rapid sketching up to ready for development designs and providing support and detailed documentation. </p>

                                Not only that, but Ana was great at globalising the work done by the team, but also making sure any requests were sensible to be allowed to approach the table.
