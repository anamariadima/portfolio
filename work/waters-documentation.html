                            <p class="default__text"> Launching new documentation was indeed a challenge. We needed to <b>inform</b> the entire company about our 
                                release, present all the benefits of using it, and make it clear that this documentation would be the only one that is up to date 
                                and would have updated versions every quarter. </p>
                            <p class="default__text"> Initially, it was tough, as we received many questions and requirements at the team level on our support 
                                channel, but over time, <b>we learned to organize</b> through meetings and offline, and refined our strategy to better inform everyone 
                                within the organization.</p>
                            <p class="default__text"> By having reliable support, a robust documentation and an up-to-date design system, the number of

                            <p class="default__text"> In our organization, we previously had four separate places to find information, and our consumers had to 
                                search through all these different spaces to find a simple information. Did they know where to find these sources? 
                                Did they ask other teams or our team? </p>
                            <p class="default__text"> ✅ Our solution <b>simplified</b> everything by creating a single source of truth—comprehensive documentation 
                                where they can access guidelines, release notes, foundations, patterns, design and code, all in one up-to-date space, 
                                implemented in Zeroheight.</p>
                            <p class="default__text"> 🙌 The impact on users was significant, <b>saving time, resources, and money</b> across the organization by

                            <p class="default__text"> 🧏‍♀️ By consistently advocating for accessibility, simplicity, consistency, and transparency, we can achieve 
                                the best results, regardless of the project type. Moreover, the power of teamwork should never be underestimated—<b>collaborating</b> 
                                effectively can drive success beyond what we could achieve individually. </p>
