                                through numerous information sources. Currently, we have a UI guide in Confluence, design components, wireframes, prototypes 
                                and examples in Figma and Zeplin, and implemented components along with other guidelines in Storybook.  </p>
                            <p class="default__text"> That’s a lot, right? Should every team member be expected to know how to search through all these sources?

                            <p class="default__text">⭐️ The challenge was to <b>create a single source of truth documentation </b> by gathering information from all 
                                our applications, cases, and teams.</p>
                            <p class="default__text">🥅 The goal was to <b>comprehensively cover everything</b> that can help our users by providing guidelines, 
                                clear documentation, and full implementation.</p>
                            <p class="default__text">💡 <b>Searching and testing</b> if Zeroheight is the perfect space for us, and providing support and documentation that fit the 
                                needs of almost 30 teams, was indeed a huge deal.</p>

                            <p class="default__text">→ Schedule <b>weekly calls</b> focused on design work (to discuss iterations, issues, constraints, and gather feedback). </p>
                            <p class="default__text">→ <b>Moderate</b> weekly design-development calls (to discuss implementation feasibility, priorities, timelines, and create Jira epics & stories). </p>
                            <p class="default__text">→ Assign a technical writer, along with another designer and manager, to ensure a <b>consistent voice and tone</b> throughout the documentation.</p>
                            <p class="default__text">→ <b>Involve all team members</b> in creative sessions, brainstorming, design reviews, and design system updates. </p>
                            <p class="default__text">→ Establish a <b>clear process</b> for designers to contribute to the design system: submitting requests, presenting ideas, creating branches, and seeking feedback from the design and development team. </p>
                            <p class="default__text">→ <b>Test more</b> with users (testing new concepts and prototypes before implementation).</p>

                            <p class="default__text"> Launching new documentation was indeed a challenge. We needed to <b>inform</b> the entire company about our 
                                release, present all the benefits of using it, and make it clear that this documentation would be the only one that is up to date 
                                and would have updated versions every quarter. </p>
                            <p class="default__text"> Initially, it was tough, as we received many questions and requirements at the team level on our support 
                                channel, but over time, <b>we learned to organize</b> through meetings and offline, and refined our strategy to better inform everyone 
                                within the organization.</p>
                            <p class="default__text"> By having reliable support, a robust documentation and an up-to-date design system, the number of

                            <p class="default__text"> In our organization, we previously had four separate places to find information, and our users had to

                            <p class="default__text"> ✅ Our solution <b>simplified</b> everything by creating a single source of truth—comprehensive documentation in Zeroheight
                                where they can access all the needed informations.</p>
